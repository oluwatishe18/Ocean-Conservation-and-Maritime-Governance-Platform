# Ocean Conservation and Maritime Governance Platform

A comprehensive blockchain-based system for protecting marine ecosystems and managing maritime activities through smart contracts.

## Overview

This platform consists of five interconnected smart contracts that work together to:
- Prevent illegal fishing in protected waters
- Track and coordinate ocean pollution cleanup
- Manage marine protected areas
- Regulate deep sea mining activities
- Resolve maritime boundary disputes

## Smart Contracts

### 1. Illegal Fishing Prevention Contract (`illegal-fishing-prevention.clar`)
- Monitors fishing vessel activities
- Enforces fishing quotas and seasonal restrictions
- Issues violations and penalties for illegal fishing
- Manages fishing licenses and permits

### 2. Ocean Pollution Tracking Contract (`ocean-pollution-tracking.clar`)
- Records pollution incidents and sources
- Coordinates cleanup efforts
- Tracks pollution remediation progress
- Manages environmental impact assessments

### 3. Marine Protected Area Management Contract (`marine-protected-area.clar`)
- Defines and manages protected marine zones
- Enforces conservation rules and restrictions
- Monitors ecosystem health metrics
- Issues permits for research activities

### 4. Deep Sea Mining Regulation Contract (`deep-sea-mining-regulation.clar`)
- Governs seabed resource extraction permits
- Enforces environmental impact limits
- Monitors mining operations compliance
- Manages restoration requirements

### 5. Maritime Boundary Dispute Resolution Contract (`maritime-boundary-dispute.clar`)
- Provides neutral arbitration for territorial disputes
- Manages evidence submission and review
- Facilitates mediation between parties
- Records dispute resolutions

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Governance**: Community-driven decision making for marine conservation
- **Transparent Monitoring**: All activities recorded on blockchain for accountability
- **Automated Enforcement**: Smart contract-based rule enforcement
- **Dispute Resolution**: Built-in arbitration system for conflicts
- **Environmental Protection**: Focus on sustainable ocean resource management

## Data Structures

Each contract uses optimized data structures for:
- Vessel and entity registration
- Activity monitoring and reporting
- Violation tracking and penalties
- Permit and license management
- Environmental impact assessment

## Getting Started

1. Deploy contracts to Stacks blockchain
2. Register vessels, entities, and protected areas
3. Begin monitoring and enforcement activities
4. Use dispute resolution system as needed

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
\`\`\`bash
npm test
\`\`\`

## Contributing

This platform is designed to protect our oceans for future generations. Contributions focused on improving conservation effectiveness are welcome.
